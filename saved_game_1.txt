You are in the dungeon.  It's musky in here.  You have a small straw matress on the floor.  It's extremely uncomfortable.  You've been here for a while.  It smells bad, partly due to the rats, and partly due to the mold growing on the ceiling.  How much more of this can you take?  On the East side of the cell is the cell door.  The other sides are stone walls.

You are in the guard room.  This is where the guards keep their gear.  There are random pieces of armor laying around.  It is somewhat messy in here.  It seems that they use this room more for storage than anything else.  Luckily you haven't seen any guards since you were in the dungeon, however you may want to be cautious going forward.  This room is pretty large.  You notice a large door to the West.  The wooden door that leads back to the basement is to the North.

They seem to be unruly and restless.  The room is somewhat small, but you notice a window to the North.  The window is pretty high up but there is a hook next to the window.  It would be a long fall.  Below the window is the Place of Arms.  There are no other doors other than the one facing East that you came from.

Luckily there are no guards here.  You can't help but wonder what it would be like to be in combat again.  It has been years since you've wielded a sword.  Luckily, combat is like riding a bike, and you feel confident in your abilities.  To the South you see the window that you climbed out of with the rope still hanging down.  To the East you a staircase.  Where could it lead?

You are in the pantry.  There is a large door in the corner of the room but it is locked.  There is a old door behind you to the East, but that only leads back to the Kitchen.  There is a lot of food stored in here.  You notice some mice crawling around.  There are many loafs of bread on the shelves.  There is some meet being dried in the corner.  It looks appetizing until you notice a roach crawl out from under one of the pieces.  After spending so much time locked up it would be nice to have food like this, but you'd probably rather escape the castle than have a good meal.

guard
The guards take turns patrolling the castle.  You won't be able to sneak past him.  Sneaking up on him may not be an option either, although you have a good view of him from where you are standing.  He isn't looking your way, and isn't wearing armor...

You are in the treasure room.  There is treasure everywhere.  To the South is the tunnel leading back to the pantry.  To the West is a vaulted door.  There are diamonds and rubies all over the floor.  There are gold amulets hanging on the walls.  You get the feeling that not a lot of people come into this room.

You have entered the chapel.  There are paintings covering the walls.  You see books laid throughout the chapel.  There is a fountain that contains holy water.  To the east is the vaulted door back to the treasure room.  To the North you notice a gilded door.  It has been many years since you have visited a chapel.  You used to be a religious man, but prisoners are prevented from attending religious services.

You are in the master bed chamber.  This is where the king sleeps.It's dark in here.  You can somewhat make out what is in the room, but without light you may be missing some stuff.  The bed is huge.  Now you understand why they call large beds "King Size".  There are curtains all around the bed.  There are some windows and the sun is peering in.  There is a table in the corner.  There is a fireplace, but no fire going right now.  To the South is the gilded door leading back to the chapel room.  You notice a double door to the West.

You are in the great hall.  This is where the King and all of the Lords come to feast. There is a long table surrounded on both sides by chairs.  The table is set in preparation for the next meal.  There are hunting trophies hung on all of the walls and tapestries draped from the ceilings.  There are candles everywhere but none of them are lit right now.  To the East is the double door leading back to the master bed chamber.  To the North you notice a royal door.

You are in the throne room.  This is where the King spends most of his day.  It is decorated on all sides with the King's family crest.  There are swords hanging from the walls.  There are seats along the sides of the room where the King's advisors sit when giving him council.  It smells of incense in here.  To the South there is a royal door, the only door in this room.
