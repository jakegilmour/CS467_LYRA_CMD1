place of arms
It's dark in here.  You can somewhat make out what is in the room, but without light you may be missing some stuff.  There are weapons everywhere.  Luckily there are no guards here.  You can't help but wonder what it would be like to be in combat again.  It has been years since you've wielded a sword.  Luckily, combat is like riding a bike, and you feel confident in your abilities.  To the South you see the window that you climbed out of with the rope still hanging down.  To the East you see a door to a staircase that is open.  Where could it lead?

It is very dark in here.  You might have an easier time moving forward if you could see better.
