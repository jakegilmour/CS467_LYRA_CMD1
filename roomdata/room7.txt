Lavatory
You are in the lavoratory.  There are stone walls all around, but this lavoratory has doors in two directions.  You came through the small door to the South, and you notice another small door on the North side of the room.  The smell in here is overpowering, although you can't help but think that it must be nice to have a bathroom outside of your sleeping quarters.  There is a small window at the top of the room.  You can't see out of it, but it must be to help ventilate the room.
You are in the lavoratory.  It smells awful in here.  This lavoratory has doors in two directions, one to the North and one to the South.  The small door to the South leads back to the Solar Room.  The small door to the north seems like the best way out of here.

The window looks a little high too jump, if only you had a little more courage...
