Treasure Room
You are in the Treasure Room.  There is treasure everywhere.  To the South is the small door leading back to the Pantry.  To the West is a vaulted door.  There are diamonds and rubies all over the floor.  There are gold amulets hanging on the walls.  You get the feeling that not a lot of people come into this room.
