pantry
You are in the pantry.  There is a large door in the corner of the room but it is locked.  There is a old door behind you to the East, but that only leads back to the Kitchen.  There is a lot of food stored in here.  You notice some mice crawling around.  There are many loafs of bread on the shelves.  There is some meet being dried in the corner.  It looks appetizing until you notice a roach crawl out from under one of the pieces.  After spending so much time locked up it would be nice to have food like this, but you'd probably rather escape the castle than have a good meal.

There is a guard in your way, how can you defeat him?
